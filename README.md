# A-Machine-Learning-Approach-to-Analyzing-Development-Aid-in-Conflict-and-Peace-Contexts

## Project Overview

This project implements a **reproducible machine learning pipeline** to semantically classify peace-related development aid projects using **zero-shot text classification**. The main objective is to map CRS purpose code 15220 (‚ÄúCivilian peace-building, conflict prevention and resolution‚Äù) to specific **SDG sub-targets** (e.g., 16.1, 16.2, 5.2) using transformer models (BART-MNLI, GPT-4), and to analyze how aligned these projects are with conflict indicators across countries.
